## System Overview
This project helps a consumer to remotely control a firefighting robot with a water tank to extinguish the flames. Bluetooth is used to control this system. The android app system sends commands to the vehicle's Bluetooth receiver. The water tank, a pump, and a spray that can spray water when required are all included in the system. To guide the spray path, which must be sprayed upward and downward on the object to dampen the fire, we used a servo motor. When the device sensors reach a predetermined threshold, the buzzer will sound an alarm. The four geared motors assist the robot in moving forward and backward, and one dc motor driver is connected to control the geared motor through our Android app. The LCD will display the current temperature, allowing the robot to be sent to disaster areas.
